Version 0.1
-----------
First public release

Version 0.2
-----------
- Added online help
- Added restore function
- Small cosmetic changes (icons on buttons)

Version 0.21
------------
- When restoring to an alternative location, only the directory and contents specified in the profile are restored, not the entire path from the top level.
- The restore location which is displayed is now the parent directory into which the archive will be restored.

Version 0.22
------------
- When backing up or restoring, backerupper now checks that the target directory is writeable, and displays a message if it's not.

Version 0.23
------------
- Fixed bugs which caused access violations when clicking on various controls when no profiles were defined.
- Fixed bug which caused backups to fail with directories containing spaces in the name.
- Possibly fixed unconfirmed bug whereby clicking on a directory button in the New Profile dialog gave an Invalid Floating Point error.

Version 0.24
------------
- Tray icon context menu now remains visible after right-clicking the icon.
- The bugfix in version 0.23 for directories with spaces in the name fixed one problem but created another. This bug is now fixed properly (I hope!).
- When first run, this version checks all the profile pathnames and removes any quotes or escape characters added by previous versions.
- When editing or creating a profile, it is now not possible to type quotes or escape characters into the pathname, as this would conflict with the bugfix for spaces in directory names.
