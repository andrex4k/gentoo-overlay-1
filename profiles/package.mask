# The use of this application can be unsafe for you
#
# ** I'd rather this project be euthanized than patched. The project is dead, looking for a new maintainer, and 
# ** entirely unsafe in its implementation. If I were to send any PR, it'd be to add this warning to the README.
# **
# ** As mentioned in the OP, this was handled privately, via encrypted email, and remained unaddressed for three weeks 
# ** before I posted this publicly. Now, at least, people can know what they're getting into and 
# ** the new maintainer has a list of items to tackle first.
# ** Seriously though, my recommendation stands. People should stop using fiche on their public servers
# ** until it's been entirely reworked into something safer.
# ** To prevent issues like this in other projects, C is clearly not the ideal tool for the job.
